## Type = internal Testing
##
## I think the endpoint is slightly different so I can no longer get only internal repos
## Not a permission problem as they're included when all is selected
## No documentation for type = internal for the endpoint
##
## Might have to write a manual filter by getting all repos and removing those with a visiblity
## that isnt internal
