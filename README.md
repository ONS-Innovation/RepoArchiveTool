# Github API App
A Python application to archive outdated organisation repositories.

## Setup
1. Install Poetry using `pip install poetry`.
2. Navigate into the project's folder and create a virtual environement using `python3 -m venv <environment_name>`.
3. Activate the environment using `source <environment_name>/bin/activate`.
4. Run `Poetry install` to install all the required dependencies.
5. Navigate into the repoarchivetool directory.
6. Run the project using `poetry run python3 app.py`.

## Getting a Personal Access Token (PAT)
Before you can use the application, you will need a Personal Access Token (PAT).

1. Go to Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Fine-grained Tokens.
2. Next, Click **Generate new token**

3. Create a new token by filling in the fields appropriately. **Make sure to select the organisation as the Resource Owner.**

4. Give the token access to **All Repositories** and, under Repository Permissions, **Administration (Read and Write)** and **Metadata (Read-only)** access.

5. Generate the token and make a note of it.
6. An owner of the Organisation will then need to approve the token before use.

You can now input this into the app and use it.
